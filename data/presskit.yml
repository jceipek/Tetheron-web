    In Tetheron, 2-6 players soar joyfully around a destructible arcade arena
    by tethering and swinging from obstacles and each other. With its two-finger,
    any-button controls, it's easy to learn but hard to master.


    Do you have the reflexes, cunning, and determination to triumph in this
    centripetal battle royale?
history: >
    Julian Ceipek and Patrick Quah first combined forces to make experimental
    games in Richard Lemarchand's Avant Garde video games class at USC's IMGD.
    Patrick was keen on simple, compelling arcade-style mechanics, Julian was
    interested in minimalism and juiciness, and both wanted to make a balanced,
    competitive game. The result: Tetheron.


    They used a "playcentric" approach to game design, using rapid playtesting
    and intensive iteration to improve and polish the game at every turn.


    The team sorely lacked musical direction until they met Julie Buchanan,
    a Berklee College of Music graduate. Julie composed a score and soundscape
    that reacts to and complements the gameplay--she's the reason that players
    don't claw out their ears while playing Tetheron!


    Together, they continue to work hard on refining the Tetheron experience.
